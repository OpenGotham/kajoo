improved, since Whitney was resurfaced over a year (two?) ago.  Two issues arise from this.  One is:  how can we better plan for the increased precipitation that is expected to become more extreme with climate instability?  This is critical to New Haven's viability.  This needs to be a part of the City's planning for \"emergencies\" which will, in fact, become more common (like the recent snowfalls).    On a smaller matter, there is now a lake on southbound Whitney south of Canner after any and every significant rainfall.  It is dangerous to cars, it causes solenoid failure in some cars (a $500 problem if you have a VW Passat), and lord help you if you are a pedestrian on that corner (as many people are on any school morning).  Please fix this small problem, and address the larger issue or explain to us what the citizenry needs to do to be in on a plan for increased precipitation and higher water levels.","slug":"87092-drainage-plan-for-new-haven","address":"500-516 Whitney Ave New Haven, CT 06511, USA","summary":"Drainage Plan for New Haven","object_id":"issue87092","issue_id":87092,"id":"issue87092","updated_at_raw":"2011/03/09 22:24:40 +0000","minutes_since_created":730,"lat":41.3245386039137},{"created_at":"03/09/2011 at 10:22PM","page":1,"lng":-71.0965056717396,"updated_at":"03/10/2011 at 05:32AM","status":"Open","rating":2,"bitly":"http://bit.ly/gOoGll","description":"Ever since Mass Ave was repaved, there has been a perpetual puddle in the bike lane, where it angles over to the curb because Mass Ave south widens to two lanes.
